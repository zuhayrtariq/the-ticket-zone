### Setting up Clerk

2. Configure authentication providers
3. Set up redirect URLs
4. Add environment variables

### Setting up Convex

1. [Create a Convex account by Clicking here!](https://convex.dev/c/sonnysangha)
2. Create a new project
3. Install the Convex CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install convex
   ```
4. Initialize Convex in your project:
   ```bash
   npx convex init
   ```
5. Copy your deployment URL from the Convex dashboard and add it to your `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_deployment_url
   ```
6. Start the Convex development server:
   ```bash
   npx convex dev
   ```

Note: Keep the Convex development server running while working on your project. It will sync your backend functions and database schema automatically.

### Setting up Stripe

1. Create a Stripe account
2. Enable Stripe Connect
3. Set up webhook endpoints
4. Configure payment settings

### Setting up Stripe Webhooks for Local Development

1. Install the Stripe CLI:

   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

   # Windows (using scoop)
   scoop install stripe

   # Linux
   curl -s https://packages.stripe.dev/api/security/keypair/stripe-cli-gpg/public | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/stripe.gpg
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/stripe.gpg] https://packages.stripe.dev/stripe-cli-debian-local stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stripe.list
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install stripe
   ```

2. Login to Stripe CLI:

   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

3. Start webhook forwarding:

   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

4. Copy the webhook signing secret that is displayed after running the listen command and add it to your `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx
   ```

5. Keep the webhook forwarding running while testing payments locally. The CLI will forward all webhook events to your local endpoint.

Note: Make sure your webhook endpoint (`/api/webhooks/stripe`) is properly configured to handle incoming webhook events.
